# Discipulis - Flask

I originally made Discipulis in Flask, but then I discovered Next.js and recreated Discipulis with Next.js.
This repo is not being worked on, but you can still check out its code.

If you want to see Discipulis' website or give some feature requests, check out its [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/VulcanWM/discipulis)
